### Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
The boot camp was extremely useful and provided a lot of learning opportunities for me to ingest new content and engage in leading practices for planning, installing, securing, tuning, testing and maintaining production-ready CDH cluster.
It was a challenging training with a comprehensive agenda which made it particularly efficient. I believe the training was very well planned and the use of Github was very helpful in terms of collaboration. 

### Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
High availibility was least familiar and installing through CM & recource management were most familiar. 

### Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
Creating a secure CDH cluster using kerberos was the most helpful topic. Hadoop security is a very important requirement in any new project and now I feel comfortable setting-up a kerberized environment. 

### How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I feel pretty confident that I can install a production cluster by myself. I did it for the first lab and created a highly available and kerberized CDH cluster. I had done it a few times for different clients before but I learned many important tricks during this boot camp.
Even though, I did not finish the second lab in 3 hours because of a new MySQL access issue which was resolved towards the end, I am comfortable with installing a production cluster given the reasonable timeframe for a large scale project.
